# Objectives
- **Using the occupancy labels, determine at which times in the day each specific room is occupied.**
- **This information can in turn be used to prepare the room in advance for the expected arrival of individuals in that room**
    - e.g. Prepare bathroom for expected arrival at 7:30
    - The house acts as a smart home that learns each user's behaviour. This way homeowners don't need to define these rules themselves
    - It can save power because a room that is rarely used doesn't need to be constantly ventilated
- **The information can also be used to  predict the flow people follow in the house**
   - e.g. get out of bed --> go to bathroom to freshen up --> go to kitchen to eat breakfast --> leave the house for work
   - Don't really know if this has a real use-case
