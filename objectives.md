# Objectives
1. **Using the occupancy labels, determine at which times in the day each specific room is occupied.**
2.  **This information can in turn be used to prepare the room in advance for the expected arrival of individuals in that room**
    - e.g. Prepare bathroom for expected arrival at 7:30
    - This can also save power because that is rarely used doesn't need to be constantly ventilated
3. **The information can also be used to create som sort of Markov chain that determines the flow people follow in the house**
   - e.g. get out of bed --> go to bathroom to freshen up --> go to kitchen to eat breakfast --> leave the house for work
